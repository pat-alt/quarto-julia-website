title: Quarto Extensions for the Julia Community
description: |
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that was first presented at JuliaCon 2022. We propose new extensions and workflows that we hope will help the community embrace this promising new tool and boost developers' efforts toward effective communication and reproducibility.
