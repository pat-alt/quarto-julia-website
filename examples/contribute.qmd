# Showcase Your Work

If you have a project that you've built using one of our extensions, we'd love to feature it in our [showcase](index.qmd). Sharing your work here is easy, especially if you're already familiar with Quarto. Just follow the steps below to submit your project.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Set up a new branch in your fork with the name `showcase/your-project-name`.
3. In the [`examples/contributed`](https://github.com/pat-alt/quarto-julia-website/tree/main/examples/contributed/){target="_blank"} (or one of the subdirectories), create a new directory with the name of your project.
4. Add an `index.qmd` file to the directory you just created. This file will be one of the following (preferably the first):
   1. A brief description of your project and a link to the actual project file (if it's already written in Quarto), which you should also include in the same directory.
   2. Your actual project, if it's already written in Quarto (e.g. a presentation or article).

Your project will automatically be included in the showcase once your pull request is merged. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to open an issue. We're happy to help!
